# FullTextSearchFun

Wherein an intrepid team build a time machine to travel forward to the year 2020. Having arrived in the distant future, they first obtain hoverboards and escape the local high school bully in an epic chase scene through the streets of New York. Next they infiltrate the MongoDB engineering organisation. Lucky for them, no one has changed their password in 2 years so they gain easy access to internal repos. With the skill of technical ninjas, they extract the new-and-improved full text search feature then fade like smoke.

After further adventures and much derring-do, our brave heroes return to the present bearing their gift to humanity.

Also, hoverboards.
